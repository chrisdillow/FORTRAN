# FORTRAN
Programs written in the FORTRAN language.
Programs will have the .f90 extension.
To run .f90 programs, you will need to compile them with a software like MinGW.
  When MinGW is installed, you will need to opt in for gfortran.
  To compile the .f90 for running, make sure you are in the correct directory for the file and enter the following:
  gfortran filename.f90 -0 outputnamehere
  Hit enter.
  Msys will compile into an exe.
  Run the ls command to list the files.
  To run your .exe output of the code, type the following:
  ./outputnamehere.exe
  The program will run in msys.
